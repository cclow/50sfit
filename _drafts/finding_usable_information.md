Read the source documents, find credible analysts and reporters

Finding credible information is often the hardest part of starting a healthy practice. We are familiar with snake-oil dealers, quick to make dubious claims based on flimsy evidence and conjectures. Seemingly credible sources might scarcely do better. Most journalists I've found to be ill equipped to interprete the results and verify the claims of scientific reports. Researchers have been found to skew their publications and conclusions based on ideology rather than strict interpretation of their experimental results. And most doctors and nutritionists are still ignorant or resistant to the tsunami of new research published after their university textbooks where published.

To be fair, the effect of our diets on our bodies is extermenely complex. Few of the mechanisms and factors affecting our bodies are well understood, and much of these information are still evolving. It is common to find similar experiments that legitimately lead to drastically different conclusions.

Please don't say "Everything in Moderation"

"Just do everything in moderation," a phrase that while I admit contains some truth, I dislike. It is an abrogation of the responsibility to taking care of our body, the enabler of our lives. It also might not always be the best advice; you would not take arsenic in moderation, instead, you would be wise to know that it is poison and to avoid it completely.

This is not to say we all need to be experts. Most of us don't have the time, access to the resources, or the educational background to understand them thoroughly. Where possible, take the time to follow a claim in a book or an article to its source. This could be the science report, often found on PubMed or through an iOS app like "Read by QxMD". Find about common biases in scientific reports and keep a look out for those in the reports you read.

The benefits are two fold: you have now understood the report from the source, and you have now some idea of the quality of the author in discerning the validity of the source, and accurately representing it to you and the broader audience.

Over time, you'll find credible authors and reporters, and learn to avoid others. These will help you find asnd inteprete good information with less effort.

Regardless, you'll also find that everyone has her own biases. By reading widely and critically you would be able to find the right balance of information and opinions to help you guide your health and fitness practices.
