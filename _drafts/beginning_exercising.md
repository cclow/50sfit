Why are you exercising?

You cannot outexercise your diet

Exercise by itself does not make you stronger or fitter

If you're not sleeping at least 7 hours, go work on that first

Start slow, much slower than you think

Muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones

Exercise is not for "burning calories"

Keep the dates, be flexible on volume and intensity

Work in incidental exercises
