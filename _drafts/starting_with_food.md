This probably comes as no surprise that diet is the most important factor affecting our body weight and health.
When we think about getting healthy or losing weight, a diet is usually the first thing to come to mind.

During my late thirties and early forties,  I was running regularly about 2 to 3 times weekly.
That did not make much difference to my weight until I made changes in my diet. Our food are more than just capsules of energy, their constituents affect our hormonal system that affects whether we feel hungry, whether we store the excess energy as fat, and how we feel, among other things. Additonally, food can provide necessary building blocks for repairing our body, or they could be destructive agents.

The quality and types of food you eat are important, perhaps more so than the quantity of food and their nominal calories count.

And more importantly when I say diet, it's never about one that last a couple of months or weeks. It's not about a shock therapy, a deprivation that you apply to your body so that it'll quickly lose the weight. It is about making lasting changes in how and what you eat.


Most diets work in the short term.
The details seem to matter little, just by being aware of what and how much we eat is often enough to provide results.
Unfortunately this has resulted in many quick fix diets that depend on short term partial starvation or food substitution, 
and these diets are ineffective in the long run.

It's been estimated that more than 80% of dieters regain their lost weights within a year.
A particularly grim illustration of this fact is reported by the New York Time's in [After 'The Biggest Loser,' Their Bodies Fought to Regain Weight](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/02/health/biggest-loser-weight-loss.html).

Diets based on partial starvation take tremendous willpower to maintain,
and our bodies respond to such diets by lowering our base metabolic rate, making us less energetic and weight loss more difficult.

An effective diet  must be maintainable over a long time.
Instead of relying on short term starvation, it must be a sustainable long term pattern of eating. [^fasting-exception] It should not take more willpower since we now know that our willpower are limited and should be conserve for more important decision making. [^ego-depletion]

We must also be patient when making diet changes for weight loss and health. Our current poor health is a result of accumulation over many months if not years of bad lifestyle and eating habits. It is reasonable to expect lasting changes to take at least months, and not weeks. Short term results are unlikely to address deeper issues and unlikely to effect long term differences.

What we eat matters a lot more than how much we eat. Contrary to common practice, I do not count or estimate my calories intake even once since I started eating differently. My food portion control consists of stopping when I'm full.

Different food affects how much we eat. Eating the right food provides satiety and tells our bodies when we have enough, the wrong food might encourage us to keep eating. We've all experienced "You Can't Just Eat One" potato chips or snack that are similarly formulated with the right sweetness, saltiness and oiliness to be ultrapalatable.

My diet principle is simple: replace bad food with good satiating food, eat a variety and not overeat in any category. This is not news to most of us. There are two main questions in the implementation:

* What constitute good and bad food? What are the food to eliminate or reduce, and what do we replace them with?
* How do we effectively replace these food without resorting to enormous willpower?

Lets address the question of good and bad food first. I know some of these would require explanation so I'll provide more details subsequently.
* If you can only do one thing as a result of reading this, reduce your sugar intake. Reduce sugar and all products with excessive sugar, whether natural or otherwise. This includes fruit juice, Milo/Horlicks/Ovaltine, low fat milk/yogurt, breakfast cereal, and energy drinks.
* Eliminate or at least reduce deep fried food, margarine, hydrogenated oils, and vegetable seed oils such as those from canola, rapeseed, corn, cottonseed, sunflower, soybean, safflower, though these are frequently mistaken for healthy oils. Don't be afraid to replace these with saturated oils such as from ghee from grass-fed cows, coconut, avocado, macadamia, olive or those occurring naturally in eggs, nuts, oily fish, cheese, butter, full cream milk, grass fed beef, lamb, pork, etc. Most of these are highly satiating so you would probably not overeat, but do be careful of some like nuts where it is possible to eat too much of.
* Eliminate or at least reduce processed food and food like substances, replace them with real food, i.e. where you can still see the individual meat, vegetables, and whatever ingredients that go into them.
* Eat lots of vegetable, especially leafy and less starchy ones. If you're only eating lots of corns, potatoes, and soy products, you probably need to expand this range drastically.
* Meat, especially red meat and organ meats, had been demonised together with saturated fats and cholesterol rich foods. Like fats, there are good and bad meats, and like fats, the good ones are hugely satiating and beneficial to our health when taken appropriately.
* Reduce intake of carbohydrate. Most people consider eating carbo the healthy way to get full, but in my experience most people do not feel full because they are eating too little satiating food like meat and the right fats. Taken alone, carbohydrates are broken down into monosaccharides, or simply, sugar, before absorption into the body. They affect us the same way sugar does.
* Reduce or eliminate wheat products, such as bread, pasta, noodles. Wheat products, besides being high in carbohydrate, is potentially highly damaging, even for non-celiacs. Personally I went from making my own bread to not consuming wheat products (except beer...) knowingly.

How do you enforce or encourage such diet changes? You'd want to stock up your pantry with things you should eat and get rid of things you should not. Get rid of all soda, syrup sweets, and empty calories snacks. Get right of pseudo-food like Eggo waffles, , breakfast cereal, energy beverages like Milo, instant noodles, or, really, anything that's "instant". Replace them with no sugary sparkling water (a sodastream machine helps a lot), dark chocolate, vegetable sticks, eggs, anchovies and sardines in olive oil, cheese, beef jerky, and nuts. Learn to drink your coffee and tea with no or reduced sugar.

### Sugar

Reduce your sugar intake is perhaps the single most important thing you should do. Sugar provides empty calories that you don't need since energy from other food are sufficient. An elevated blood sugar level increases insulin levels which encourages production of triglyceride and storage of fat. Prolonged elevated insulin levels increases the probability of type 2 diabetes, affects our leptin sensitivity (which is the main mechanism to curb our appetite), causes chronic inflammation and all sorts of problems in our bodies. Some forms of sugar, such as fructose can only be processed by the liver and diverts the liver from other crucial functions.

Sugar is present in many food we take. Most of our drinks are choked full of sugar. Personally I've stopped drinking any soda, and all my coffee and tea these days are without sugar.

Seemingly healthy drinks like fruit juice, even freshly squeezed pack a large dose of sugar. The same goes for dried fruits. While most fruits are sugary, eating them fresh is seldom a problem since we are also taking in the bulk and would feel full after an appropriately small amount.

Beverages advertised as healthy such as Milo / Ovaltine / Horlicks are also manufactured with large amount of HFCS (High Fructose Corn Syrup). HFCS is found in most if not all process food. [^food-like-substance] In "low fat" or "reduced fat" food, for example low fat yogurt, low fat milk, HFCS is frequently used to replace taste that's removed with the fat. Ironically, most fat removed, is found to be not as harmful as the HFCS replacing it.

Breakfast cereal is a particularly insidious offender since most are packed with very high amounts of sugar.

[^fasting-exception]: Not all short term caloric restriction are bad if they are used for a specific purpose as part of long term strategies. For example, fasting is sometimes used to activate autophaghy and encourage usage of fat for energy.
