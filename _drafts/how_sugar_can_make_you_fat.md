## Fat Storage is Increased

Your pancreas produces insulin to regulate your blood sugar level when you consume sugar or carbohydrates.

Insulin lowers blood sugar by promoting its storage into our muscles, livers and fat cells.
In conjunction, insulin promotes the metabolism of glycogen for energy production, and shuts down fatty acids metabolism and the release of fatty acids from fat cells.

By itself this is a natural response.
Under normal amounts of carbohydrate intakes, the excess is quickly stored away and used up.
As insulin levels decrease, fatty acids stored in the fat cells are released as additional energy source.
In fact, when we're at rest, roughly 70% of our energy comes from fats.

Consider if blood sugar levels are kept high, either by an extraordinary initial dose or with continual replenishment.
Insulin levels are kept high, fat storage is increased while fat usage is decreased, and this causes a net increase in fat storage.

## Sugar Crash

An effect of consuming large amount of carbohydrates is sugar crash.
Sugar crash occurs when a spike in blood glucose triggers an insulin spike, which in turn could drives blood glucose levels too low.
You might have experienced this crash as fatigue, headache, brain fog, lack of focus, and irritability.

Before I changed my diet, I would often feel this low blood sugar level in mid-afternoon, and would need something sweet.

Reducing your sugar intake is perhaps the single most important thing you should do.
Sugar provides empty calories that you don't need.
Why consume calories without nutrients when other more nutritious foods can also provide the calories?

An elevated blood sugar level increases insulin levels which encourages production of triglyceride and storage of fat. Prolonged elevated insulin levels increases the probability of type 2 diabetes, affects our sensitivity to being full[^leptin], causes chronic inflammation and all sorts of problems in our bodies.

Those of us with children would also be familiar with the "sugar crash" syndrome.
Consumption of high glycemic index food, causes a rapid blood sugar rise, which in turn triggers a reactive drop in blood sugar level, or hypoglycaemia.
This is often manifested by fatigue, irritability, and ability to focus.

Some forms of sugar, such as fructose, are low glycemic, but often found as 50% of  sucrose, or 55% of High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS).
While it does not cause the same insulin spike reaction, fructose can only be processed by the liver, thereby increasing the workload of the liver.
In sever cases, it can cause fatty liver.

Sugar is present in many food we take. Most of our drinks are choked full of sugar. Personally I've stopped drinking any soda, and all my coffee and tea these days are without sugar.

Eat fresh fruits, instead of drinking fruit juice, even freshly squeezed ones.
Fruit juice might seem healthy, but they delivery a large does of sugar in a short time, while eliminating much of the fibre and nutrients in the fruit pulp.
Dried fruits also has high sugar concentration and should be eaten sparingly.

Beverages advertised as healthy, such as Milo / Ovaltine / Horlicks, are also manufactured with large amount of HFCS (High Fructose Corn Syrup). HFCS is found in most if not all process food. [^food-like-substance] In "low fat" or "reduced fat" food, for example low fat yogurt, low fat milk, HFCS is frequently used to replace taste that's removed with the fat. Ironically, most fat removed, is found to be not as harmful as the HFCS replacing it.
