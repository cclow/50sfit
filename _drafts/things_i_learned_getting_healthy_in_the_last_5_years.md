## Weight Loss Is Just One Aspect of Getting Healthy

We speak of losing weight as synonymous as getting healthy or fit. And for good reasons. Bad health is most visibly manifested by excessive weight. In turn, excessive body weight affects our mobility, our athletic performance, our appearance and our self-image.

To many, losing weight becomes the end-goal. This approach is problematic for a number of reasons. Losing weight when you are overweight can improve your appearance and performance, but done the wrong way, it can hurt other parts of your health.

Does your diet and exercise leave you tired, in bad mood, or in pain?

Focusing on weight ignores body composition, remember that muscles (which you want) are more dense than fat (which you do not).

Obsessing with low weight has also lead to unhealthy practices. Liposuction, extreme wight loss supplements, practices, are obvious examples. Less obviously many endurance atheletes might be compromising their health in pushing to burn more calories.

Being underweight can be just as unhealthy as being overweight. It is possible to be too low in body fat, although most of us would not mind that.
