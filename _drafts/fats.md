Contrary to popular belief, our body fats are not just direct deposit of fat we consume. Eating more fat does not automatically make you fat.
In fact, consumption of sugar, and the reactions it invoke on our bodies, promotes fat storage more than consumption of fats.

Fat is not a homogeneous food group, 

For decades, saturated fat is linked to chronic heart and vestibular diseases, and its consumption is discouraged in dietary guidelines.
This has been reversed in the latest guidelines, it is now recognised that there are no evidence that such a link exists.

Some fats, such as in the omega 3 and omega 6 families, are building blocks of our mitochondria, and essential to our bodies.
The ratio between omega 3 and omega 6 has been linked to systemic inflammation and various diseases.
Turns out that most of us have (way) too much omega 6 compared to omega 3.

To complicate matters, both omega 3 and omega 6 are polyunsaturated fatty acids. Polyunsaturated fatty acids are fragile, and can turn into trans fat, or get rancid, under heat and light.
