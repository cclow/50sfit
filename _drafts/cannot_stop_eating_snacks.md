We frequently hear people complaining about their lack of willpower in controlling their food choices. It's true, studies have shown that our willpower is indeed limited [TK link to ego depletion] and preferably we can conserve it on things that matter.

Is this also your reason for not eating healthier? If it is, stop right here and go take a look at your fridge, kitchen, pantry, wherever you store food. Do you see more snacks that you know are not that great for you or do you see more wholesome unprocessed food? By having these ultra-palettable snacks, designed so "you can't stop at one", you then have to expend willpower to stop eating them. Much easier not having them in the house.

But... but how can we go cold-turkey on snacks? What if we are hungry at odd times? Not having snacks at home might just drive us to go for midnight pratas.

More power to you if you can completely eliminate snacks, but reducing the amount, and switching to healthier snacks would still be a step forward.

We all know that we can snack on vegetable sticks, avocadoes, fruits (not juice, and low sugar if possible) without causing too much harm. The good news is that some tasty food are actually not as unhealthy as we though. Cheese, nuts, dark (>80%) chocolate, sardines, anchovies, smoked oysters, roasted peppers, olives, beef jerky, etc, are all snack sized food that can pack a flavour punch (Though not everyone would appreciate the same foods). Either way, keep in mind that it is possible to overeat the healthiest food.
