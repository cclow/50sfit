Did you know that mushrooms are not plants?
In fact, mushrooms belong to a whole separate kingdom, with more than 1.5 
million discovered types of fungi, making its variety six times that of the 
plant kingdom.
The fungi kingdom is also more closely related to animals than any other 
kingdom, so much so that a super-kingdom joining the animal and fungi kingdoms 
was proposed.
Human share with fungi between 40 to 60% of our DNA, and 80 to 85% of our 
Ribosomal DNA.

This proximity helps make mushroom medicine more bio-available than those 
from other sources. 
As medicine, many fungi species can act as immuno-moderators, i.e. they can 
stimulate and suppress the immune system as required.
About 40% of our pharmaceuticals comes from fungi.
Mushrooms are also well represented in traditional medicines.
In China, 灵芝 or Reishi, and 冬虫夏草 or Cordyceps, are both highly priced and 
sought after.

## Reishi (灵芝)

The Reishi is widely considered as the queen of mushrooms.
It is used in Chinese medicine since the Han dynasty, more than 2000 years 
ago, making it one of the oldest medicinal mushrooms.
In Chinese, it is thought to be a herb of "spiritual potency" and to 
contribute to immortality.

Reishi is an adaptogen, one of a "class of metabolic regulators (of a natural
origin) which increase the ability of an organism to adapt to environmental
factors and to avoid damage from such factors."
Among its beneficial effects, it is believed to lower stress, reduce allergic 
reactions, improve and cleanse the liver, help control blood glucose levels, 
and to improve sleep quality.

## Chaga

The Chaga mushroom is known as the kind of mushrooms.
It has a high amount of anti-oxidants, believed to be higher gram for gram
than any other natural substance.
It is high in SOD, SuperOxide Dismutase, an anti-viral and 
anti-inflammatory substance, and high in betulinic acid, one of the most 
anti-viral compounds discovered.
Chaga is also high in melanin, the pigment in our skin, eyes, and hair, 
protective against ultra-violet radiation.
It is also high in potassium, magnesium and zinc, all minerals that are 
commonly deficient in our modern diets.

## Cordyceps (冬虫夏草)

Cordyceps are a genus of fungi parasites that grow on insects and arthropods.
The most famous member of this genus, Ophiocordyceps sinensis, known to 
the chinese as 冬虫夏草, literally "winter worm, summer grass", is highly 
priced in TCM (traditional Chinese Medicine).
