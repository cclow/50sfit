## You cannot exercise away a bad diet.

This probably comes as no surprise that diet is the biggest factor for weight loss and health. When most of us think about getting healthy or losing weight, a diet is the first thing to come to mind.

This often leads to the idea that we could alleviate bad food choices by burning away the calories from food intake. "I'll have this can of soda, that's 150 calories, so I'll jog for X more minutes to burn it off later."

And lets face it, if you're permissive in your soda consumption, you're probably also having the extra cupcake, and the frappuccino, on top of your regular meals, creating a calorie surplus you won't have enough time in the day to "burn off".

When I first started on my own health journey, I was running about 2 to 3 times weekly for about a year. That did not work until I made changes in my diet. Our food are more than just capsules of energy, their constituents affect our hormonal system that affects whether we feel hungry, whether we store the excess energy as fat, and how we feel, among other things. Additonally, food can provide necessary building blocks for repairing our body, or they could be destructive agents.

The quality and types of food you eat are important, perhaps more so than the quantity of food and their nominal calories count.

And more importantly when I say diet, it's never about one that last a couple of months or weeks. It's not about a shock therapy, a deprivation that you apply to your body so that it'll quickly lose the weight. It is about making lasting changes in how and what you eat.

## A diet is a permanent change

The title says "Things I learnt about *diet*". This only means that I will talk about diet in this article, not that it is the only factor in losing weight and staying healthy. Other factors can be broadly categorised into *movement*, and *recovery*, and I intend to write about those too. I've started with diet because it is often quick to fix and quick to show result.

The word *diet* has been hijacked to mean some short term extreme change in what we eat and how much we eat, some form of starvation and cleanse. That's not what I mean. A diet is only good if it is sustainable, if it is a way of life.

It does not mean that you stay constantly starved. Eating healthy with satiating food is possible. It also does not mean that we abstain from eating well, many delicious food that you eat today are already healthy for you. The key is to understand how certain food affect your body and let that help you decide whether to and how to eat them.

## Food is more than calories

When most people talk about diet, they would be only concerned about calories and the weight changes associated with caloric deficit or surplus. But food is more than calories.

Our bodies are constantly growing and renewing itself. We know that muscles take an average of [TK] days to completely replace itself, other soft tissues would take [TK] days, and bones [TK] days. If we imagine our bodies as houses, it's as if each brick, plaster, paintwork, piping, electric wiring, etc, are constantly being replaced. In [TK] years, we get an entirely new body.

The material for this replacement comes from our diets. The chemicals that control the replacement processes also mainly comes from our diets. Without sufficient nutrition, we would be short of material necessary to rebuild the bodies. Take an inferior diet, and we'll end up with inferior material and inferior bodies.

But food does more than supply us with body building material. Food affects how our bodies function. For instance, eating the right food might help us feel satiated and less hungry, the wrong ones might cause us to get hungry easily.

Some foods might even be damaging to the body. Wheat based products can compromise gut permeability that can in turn trigger allergic and auto-immune reactions in our bodies.
